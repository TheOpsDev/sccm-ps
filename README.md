# SCCM-PS Powershell Module

## Synopsis

Powershell module used to interact with the SCCM client (Software Center) installed on remote computers. I initially developed this module to allow automated interaction with the SCCM client on specific remote systems that cannot participate in automated reboot patch deployments. Hope this helps fellow Ops engineers!

## Exported Functions

- Check-AvailableUpdates
- Check-RebootPending
